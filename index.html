<p>“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” ? Dr. Seuss, I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!
Reading is an active mental process that promotes individual and collective progress and development. It triggers imagination, promotes quest for knowledge and activates healthy minds. Pustakaar aims at just that – <b><i>To activate healthy minds.</i></b> 
No child hates to read a book, but many don’t get an opportunity to get their hands on one. In our goal to promote literacy, we at Pustakaar simply want to start by taking a book to those children who don’t get to read one. Our mobile library is a treasure chest of books full of active imagination, which we aim to distribute amongst those children who are underprivileged and are in schools that lack the infrastructure to have a library. The idea of “borrowing” a book from a library for a whole week; holding, reading, devouring and dreaming with it over time, is to trigger positive mental development and engage in endless possibilities.
Our goal is to let a child dive into a jungle, hop onto a cloud, ride on an elephant, join in an adventure, leap on mountains, turn into a fairy or a goblin and dream. Books tell stories that let kids travel with it. It shows a potential of a world that has a promise. It lights the lamp of hope and the fire of a desire to dream big. 
For us at Pustakaar, all it takes is a bus full of enthusiastic volunteers, inspiring books and school going kids who wait eagerly to hold that one book in their hand for a week before they get another one. Come join in our quest to activate healthy minds!

<h1>Our Goal</h1>
				<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
				
<i><b>We all know that reading a book:</b></i><br />

<br><li>	Increases the aptitude for learning and prepares a person with a foundation for academic excellence. Educational researchers have found that there is a strong correlation between reading and academic success.</br>
<li>	Reinforces basic sounds that form language.
<li>	Reading to an individual fosters Pre-reading skills.
<li>	Helps a person grasp abstract concepts, apply logic in various scenarios, recognize cause and effect.
<li>	Improves vocabulary, promotes concentration.
<li>	Helps a person acquire skills that increases his potential to gain better employment.
<li>	Enhances concentration and discipline.<br />

<br><i><b>But more importantly, reading benefits in a myriad of ways including:</b></i></br>

<br><li>	Develops active imagination and gives exposure to new experiences.</br>
<li>	Helps an individual stand his ground, empathize with others, promote tolerance and broaden an individual’s vision and horizon.
<li>	Reading is an active mental process that promotes individual and collective progress and development.
<li>	Literature is an art form that crosses barriers, helps people understand each other and utilize good judgment. In other words, reading encourages empathy.
<li>	A person who is widely read is able to mix with others: he/she is a better conversationalist than those who do not read and thus promotes confidence in an individual, in other words it promotes social skills.
<li>	Gives a sneak peek into other cultures, customs and lifestyles and an exposure to the world.
<li>	It promotes an inquisitive and imaginative mind that activates knowledge and has endless possibilities.<br />

<br><b><font style="color:red">AT PUSTAKAAR OUR GOAL IS TO DO JUST THAT: 
“ACTIVATE HEALTHY MINDS”</font></b></br>

<br><b><i><font style="color:grey">THROUGH:</font></b></i></br>

<br><li>	A Medley of Imaginative books other than the ones from their curriculum.</br> 
<li>    	A Mobile Library that brings books to kids who never get a shot at reading. 
<li>		Motivate kids to dream, imagine and explore with the help of our motivated volunteers.<br />

<br><b><i><font style="color:grey">HOW:</font></b></i></br>

<br><li>	Target schools that lack the infrastructure to host libraries.</br>
<li>		Target kids who have never borrowed, read or spent time with books
<li>		Create an opportunity that is simple, effective and offers a chance in life.<br />
